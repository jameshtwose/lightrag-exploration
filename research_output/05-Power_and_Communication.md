# 05 - Power and Communication: Maintaining Essential Lifelines

When the grid goes down, power and communication become scarce, yet absolutely vital for safety and situational awareness.

## 🔌 Power Outage Solutions

### 1. **Portable Power**

* **Battery Banks:** Essential for charging phones and small devices. Keep them charged at all times.
* **Deep Cycle Batteries/Portable Power Stations:** Devices like Jackery or Goal Zero can power small appliances, lights, and medical devices for several days without noise or fumes.

### 2. **Generators**

* **Gasoline/Propane Generators:** Provide significant power but require fuel, maintenance, and produce dangerous carbon monoxide (CO) fumes.
* **Safety Rule:** **NEVER run a generator indoors, in a garage, or near windows.** Carbon monoxide kills quickly and silently. Store fuel safely and securely.

### 3. **Alternative Lighting**

* **Headlamps/LED Lanterns:** Far safer and more efficient than candles or oil lamps. Stock up on primary batteries (AA, AAA) and rechargeable batteries.
* **Solar Lights:** Small solar path lights can be brought inside at night for low-level, zero-cost lighting.

## 📻 Communication and Information

The power grid failure does not mean the end of all information.

| Tool | Function | Essential Prepping |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NOAA Weather Radio** | Provides official emergency broadcasts, weather alerts, and Civil Defense information. | **Must be hand-crank or solar powered.** Battery-only models will eventually fail. |
| **GMRS/Ham Radios** | Enables two-way communication over long distances when cell networks are down. | Requires licensing and practice (Ham), or just registration (GMRS). Get licensed and learn radio protocol now. |
| **Analog Phone** | A simple corded phone plugged directly into the wall *may* still work if the phone lines are intact (they draw power from the line, not your home). | Keep one corded phone available. |
| **Paper Maps** | Stock up on local and regional paper maps. GPS will fail without power or satellites. | Practice basic navigation (compass and map). |

## 🤝 Community Preparedness

Communication in a crisis is not just electronic. Establish a **communication plan** for your family and neighbors:

* **Rally Points:** Establish a primary location (near home) and a secondary location (further away) to meet if separated.
* **Out-of-State Contact:** Designate one non-local relative/friend as a contact point. In a local emergency, it is often easier to call long-distance than local.
* **Signal:** Agree upon a signal (e.g., three short bursts on a whistle) for urgent attention.
