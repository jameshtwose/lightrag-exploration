## 🎒 The Go-Bag (Bug-Out-Bag / BOB)

The Go-Bag is designed to sustain **one person for 72 hours (3 days)** while they are actively evacuating or "bugging out" to a safer location. It should be packed and ready to grab at a moment's notice.

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Water** | 3 liters (or filtering straw/tablets), metal water bottle. | Hydration is paramount for survival. |
