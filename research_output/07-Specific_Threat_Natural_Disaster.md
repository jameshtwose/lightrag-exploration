# 07 - Specific Threat: Natural Disaster Planning

Natural disasters are localized, impactful, and often preceded by some warning. The key is to have an **Action Plan** based on your specific regional risks.

---

## 🗺️ Know Your Risk Profile

The first step is identifying the specific threats you face.

| Regional Threat | Typical Warning Time | Primary Preparation Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Earthquake** | None (Immediate) | Structural safety (securing furniture), fire suppression, sturdy shoes, immediate $72 \text{ hour}$ Go-Bags. |
| **Hurricane/Tornado** | Hours to Days | Evacuation plan, home hardening (boards, tie-downs), full vehicle fuel tank, and cash. |
| **Flood** | Hours to Days | Elevating utilities, moving valuables to upper floors, having emergency rafts/flotation devices. |
| **Wildfire** | Hours to Days | Creating "defensible space" around the home, having a multi-route evacuation plan, N95 masks for smoke. |
| **Extreme Cold/Snow** | Days | Alternative heat source, insulating windows/doors, non-electric cooking, pipe protection. |

## 🚗 Evacuation Planning

If you are in an evacuation zone (coastal, flood plain, wildfire zone), planning is mandatory.

* **Route Maps:** Identify primary, secondary, and tertiary evacuation routes on paper maps. Roads can become blocked or gridlocked.
* **Vehicle Readiness:** Always keep your vehicle's fuel tank **at least half full**. Check tires, oil, and emergency kit regularly.
* **Pets:** Plan for your pets. Ensure you have carriers, extra food, medications, and leashes ready to go immediately. Many public shelters do not allow pets.

## 🏡 Home Hardening and Safety

Take steps now to make your home safer and more resilient:

* **Secure Objects (Earthquake):** Anchor tall, heavy furniture (bookcases, entertainment centers) to wall studs to prevent them from falling and blocking exits.
* **Shutoff Points:** Teach all capable adults and older children how to turn off the main water, gas, and electrical breakers in an emergency. **Keep a shutoff tool (wrench) attached to your gas meter.**
* **Fire Safety:** Install and regularly test smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. Keep fire extinguishers on every floor (especially kitchen/garage) and know how to use them.

> **ACTION ITEM:** Set a reminder to check the fuel in your vehicle's tank every Friday. If it's below half, fill it up.
