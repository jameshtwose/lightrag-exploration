# 06 - Specific Threat: Pandemic and Infectious Disease

A pandemic requires a unique preparation strategy focused on isolation, hygiene, and medical resources rather than physical destruction.

---

## 🦠 Proactive Measures: Isolation and Quarantine

The primary goal is to **limit contact** to break the chain of transmission.

* **Shelter-in-Place:** Have sufficient supplies (food, medicine, pet needs) to comfortably stay home for **14 to 30 days** without needing to visit a store or public area.
* **Establish a "Sick Zone":** Designate a specific room and bathroom in the house for any family member who becomes ill to quarantine, minimizing exposure to others.
* **Contamination Reduction:** Remove high-contact items from entryways (shoes, keys, coats). Immediately wash clothing worn outside.

## 😷 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

Your PPE stockpile is crucial for necessary trips outside the home.

| PPE Item | Function/Standard | Stockpile Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Face Masks** | Blocks respiratory droplets. N95 or KN95 rating is ideal for filtering airborne particles. | Enough for every person to use a fresh mask for every essential trip for a month. |
| **Gloves** | Protects hands from touching contaminated surfaces. | Nitrile or vinyl. Use once and safely discard. |
| **Eye Protection** | Protects mucous membranes of the eyes. | Goggles or face shield. |
| **Hand Sanitizer** | Disinfects hands after contact with surfaces or people. | Multiple bottles of product containing at least **$60\%$ alcohol**. |

## 🩹 Medical and Health Supplies

Stocking up on non-prescription medications and medical gear is critical, as pharmacies may be overwhelmed or closed.

* **Fever/Pain:** Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and Ibuprofen (Advil).
* **Symptom Relief:** Cough suppressants, expectorants, lozenges, and cold/flu remedies.
* **Prescription Meds:** Work with your doctor to secure a $60 \text{ to } 90 \text{ day}$ supply of all essential daily prescriptions.
* **Diagnostic Tools:** A quality **pulse oximeter** (to measure blood oxygen saturation) and a reliable thermometer. A drop in oxygen saturation is a key sign of severe respiratory illness.

## 🧼 Hygiene and Disinfection

Infectious disease relies on poor hygiene to spread.

* **Disinfectants:** Stock up on products registered by the EPA as effective against viruses. These include bleach solutions, hydrogen peroxide, and various wipes.
* **Laundry:** Ensure you have enough laundry detergent and a plan for air-drying clothes if power is out. Washing sick clothes with hot water is crucial.

> **ACTION ITEM:** Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about obtaining an extended supply of any daily essential medication you take.
