# 04 - Food Storage and Security: Building the Resilient Pantry

Food security in a crisis provides more than just calories; it offers morale and routine.

## 🍽️ The Three Tiers of Food Storage

Instead of one huge goal, break down your food storage into manageable, increasing tiers:

### Tier 1: Pantry Deepening (3 Days to 3 Weeks)

* **Focus:** Shelf-stable foods you **regularly eat**.
* **Items:** Canned soups, vegetables, beans, pasta, rice, flour, cooking oil, peanut butter, and ready-to-eat meals.
* **Strategy:** The "First In, First Out (FIFO)" method. When you use a can, buy two to replace it. This ensures rotation and fresh supplies.

### Tier 2: Mid-Term Storage (3 to 6 Months)

* **Focus:** Long-life bulk staples.
* **Items:** Large bags of rice, dried beans, oats, and wheat berries.
* **Storage:** These items should be sealed in **Mylar bags with oxygen absorbers** and then stored in food-grade plastic buckets to prevent pests, moisture, and spoilage. Store buckets in a cool, dry, dark place.

### Tier 3: Long-Term Storage (1+ Years)

* **Focus:** Freeze-dried or dehydrated meals.
* **Items:** High-calorie survival food (e.g., Mountain House, long-term survival buckets).
* **Strategy:** These are generally expensive but have a shelf life of $20-25 \text{ years}$ and require only water to prepare. These are your absolute backup.

## 🍎 Calorie Planning and Nutrition

In a sedentary survival scenario, an adult generally needs a minimum of **1,500 to 2,000 calories per day** to maintain health and function.

* **Carbohydrates:** Should form the bulk of your storage (rice, beans, pasta) for energy.
* **Proteins:** Canned meats (tuna, chicken), dried beans, and protein powder are essential for muscle maintenance.
* **Fats:** Lard, coconut oil, and peanut butter are critical, as fats provide $9 \text{ calories per gram}$—twice that of protein or carbs.
* **Supplements:** Stock multi-vitamins and electrolyte powders to prevent nutrient deficiencies.

## 🚨 Cooking Without Power

* **Propane/Butane Camping Stoves:** Excellent for short-term use, but **always use outside or with extreme ventilation** to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning.
* **Rocket Stoves:** Highly efficient, using very little fuel (twigs, leaves) to boil water or cook small meals outside.
* **Dutch Ovens:** Can be used outdoors over coals for baking and stewing.

> **ACTION ITEM:** Calculate your family's daily calorie needs. Use that number to determine how many calories you currently have stored for a 7-day period.
