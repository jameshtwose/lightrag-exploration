# 03 - Water and Sanitation: The Lifeline and The Health Barrier

Water is the most immediate critical resource. Sanitation is the most critical long-term defense against disease in a crisis.

## 💧 Water Storage and Needs

The golden rule for water is: **1 gallon per person, per day.**

### 1. **Immediate Storage**

* **Bottled Water:** Store commercially bottled water in a cool, dark location.
* **Large Containers:** Use food-grade plastic barrels ($5 - 55 \text{ gallon}$) or specialized water bricks. Treat bulk water with **plain, unscented household bleach** ($1/4 \text{ teaspoon}$ per $1 \text{ gallon}$ of water) every 6 months for indefinite storage.

### 2. **Emergency Sourcing**

When stored water runs out, you must locate a source:

* Rain collection (cisterns, tarps).
* Water heaters (can hold up to 40-60 gallons). **Turn off the gas/power before draining.**
* Toilet tanks (the bowl water is *not* safe; the tank water is clean).
* Natural sources (rivers, ponds, collected dew).

## ✅ Water Purification Methods

Never rely on a single method. Use two or more for the highest level of safety.

| Method | Effectiveness | Best Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Boiling** | Kills $100\%$ of biological pathogens (bacteria, viruses). | Most reliable method if you have fuel/fire. Must boil for **1 full minute** (3 minutes at high altitudes). |
| **Chemical** | Kills most pathogens (may not kill Cryptosporidium). | Lightweight and portable. Use purification tablets or chlorine dioxide drops. |
| **Filtering** | Removes sediment, protozoa, and bacteria. **Does not remove viruses.** | Use pump filters (e.g., Katadyn) or straw filters (e.g., Lifestraw) for on-the-go use. |
| **Solar (SODIS)** | UV rays kill pathogens in clear plastic bottles in direct sunlight. | Slow (6+ hours) but useful in sunny conditions. |

## 💩 Sanitation and Hygiene

Unmanaged waste is the #1 cause of disease spread in disaster areas.

* **The Toilet Solution:** Line a 5-gallon bucket with heavy-duty plastic garbage bags. Keep a supply of cat litter, sawdust, or dirt nearby to cover waste after each use to control odor and pests.
* **Handwashing:** Stock up on bar soap, hand sanitizer (minimum $60\%$ alcohol), and baby wipes/wet wipes for body cleaning when water is scarce.
* **Waste Disposal:** Designated waste buckets should be stored away from your living area. Be prepared to bury human waste safely away from water sources if necessary.

> **ACTION ITEM:** Inspect your water heater. Do you know how to safely turn it off and drain the potable water if you needed to?
